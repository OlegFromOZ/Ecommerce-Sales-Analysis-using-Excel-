# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis-using-Excel-
This project includes comparing sales and profit, using a waterfall chart to compare the profit of different product categories to see which category brings in the most revenue, using a map chart to compare sales across all states in America to draw conclusions about where to buy the most, top 5 products by sales, KPI and KPI_YOY (year over year) characteristics by month, and creating a beautiful and stylish dashboard to make it easy for stakeholders to make the right business decisions.
